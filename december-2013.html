                <h2>Tim Ramage</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Tim was incredible on the ███████ project. The sheer amount of time and unfaltering commitment to
                        getting one of the most advanced front-end websites that we have ever created delivered to an
                        immovable deadline was a staggering feat, and it could not have been done without his
                        leadership. The website formed a vital part of the launch of ███████'s radical new campaign,
                        together with TV promotions, heavy advertising and product redesigns which
                        are being rolled out across the US. They could not have delivered the website without MMT
                        Digital, and that's all because of the commitment from Ant, Irfan and Ross, and specifically Tim
                        for his leadership on the project.
                    </p></blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Working tirelessly, endlessly and maintaining an amazing level of optimism throughout the ███████
                        project life cycle. While others have been involved in the project it has been Tim & Nick that
                        carried it over the finish line. On top of all this, our most global and
                        recognisable client is absolutely thrilled with the end result.
